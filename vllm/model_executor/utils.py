    This is used to avoid nested cudagraph capture.

    Example:
    1. We apply torch.compile directly on some ops (e.g., grouped_topk) wrapped
    in custom ops. Inductor graph partition applies cudagraph within the custom op.
    2. At the same time, we compile the model which uses these custom ops. Inductor
    graph partition also wraps each graph partition with CUDAGraph. Some partitions
    may include custom ops, which has already been applied cudagraph. This leads to
    nested cudagraph which is not supported.

    This context manager should be wrapped around torch.compile calls within custom ops
    to avoid the nested cudagraph capture.

    Expected Usage:
    @disable_inductor_graph_partition
    @torch.compile()
    def op_eager_code(...):
        ...

    Note that `@disable_inductor_graph_partition` should be applied on top of 
    `torch.compile()`
